# Exercise 6 - Use Instant Learning to improve extraction accuracy

In the two previous excercises, we saw that some of the information did not get extracted correctly and requires manual correction. To avoid having to do the corrections over and over, we want the system to learn from our corrections, which is possible with the "Instant Learning" feature.<br>
In this excercise, we will learn how to activate Instant Learning and how to teach the system with our feedback.

## Activate Instant Learning

1. To activate Instant Learning, go to the Settings menu and chose "Manage Configuration".

## Teach the system with our corrections

1. Go to the "Bill of Lading" worklist created in the previous excercise. Alternatively, you can also use a different schema, such as the Company Registry Extract schema from excercise 1.<br>
Either select one
